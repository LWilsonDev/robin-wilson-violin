    <p>Robin Wilson was born in Canterbury in 1981 and started playing violin at the age of five. Early lessons took place at Kent Music School and he toured extensively with local groups and orchestras. In 1999, Robin went to Birmingham Conservatoire to
      study under Philippe Graffin, Peter Thomas and Clive Lander. After graduating, he began working with a variety of orchestras and groups (including Canterbury based rock band, Waterhorse), before furthering his musical training at the Royal Academy
      of Music, studying under Mateja Marinkovic.</p>


    <p>Now based in Penshurst, Robin is a freelance violinist, regularly performing with London's top orchestras including The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, The London Philharmonic Orchestra, and The Philharmonia.</p>
